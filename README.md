# PREDICTION-OF-MEDIAN-VALUE-OF-HOUSE

#	Correlation matrix and scatter plots are applied to obtain the directionality and correlation of variables.
#	Check the assumptions of linear regression, such as, check normality using residual scatter plot and normal test, check multicollinearity of feature variables using VIF and reduce it, research outlier. 
#	Select the most important feature to fit the model. Least square estimation is used to minimize the unexplained residual. Add interaction and high level of variables into the model. Applied forward, backward, and stepwise selection to find the best model.
#	Exam the goodness of the model by check the R square, adj-R square. Explain the model by illuminating the coeficient of variables.
